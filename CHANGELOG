
CHANGES for BMA 3.10
- changed on of the examples for bic.surv to match changes made to the pbc data set in the survival package

CHANGES for BMA 3.04-09
- fixed summary.bicreg to handle univariate case
- fixed problems in help files
  For.MC3.REG.Rd, MC3.REG.Rd, glib.Rd and race.Rd

CHANGES for BMA 3.02
- fixed problems in bic.glm that occurred when a two column response was specified for the binomial model, for example "cbind(y,n-y)~."

- fixed problem in bicreg that could cause multiple models having posterior probability of 1 when very large in magnitude bic values occur

- modified imageplot.bma
    - changed color scheme so that variables with positive estimates appear as one color and variables with negative estimates occur as a different color.
    - added options for ordering of variables (see documentation for details).

- modified bicreg to return "mle" as a return parameter (equal to ols)

- modified bicreg to work when only one model is selected

- added methods for iterated BMA: iBMA.glm, iBMA.bicreg and iBMA.surv, together with summary and print functions for these methods, and a new graphic function 'orderplot'.
